# Python Exercises
A collection of small programming exercises written in python to aid learning. Brief descriptions below. See folder for usage and details.

### [dbgraph.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Python-Exercises/tree/master/DBGraph)
Purpose: Queries a sqlite db and plots returned values in XKCD style using matplotlib

### [chkfile.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Utilities/tree/master/CheckFile)
Purpose: Checks the sha1 hash of a file against the writer/developers posted value

### [chkPrime.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Utilities/tree/master/CheckPrime)
Purpose: Test large integers for primality using the Rabin-Miller test

### [factorial.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Utilities/tree/master/Factorial)
Purpose: Demonstrate recursion using a factorial function as an example.

### [rot13.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Utilities/tree/master/ROT13)
Purpose: Takes a text file and outputs a ROT13 version of the file. NB ROT13 is not encryption.

### [rotgui.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Utilities/tree/master/ROT13GUI)
Purpose: Allows the user to type text and convert to a ROT13 version of the file. NB ROT13 is not encryption.

### [rps.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Python-Exercises/tree/master/RockPaperScissors)
Purpose: Play Rochambeau (rock, paper, scissors) with the computer.

### [serialdbwrite.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Utilities/tree/master/SerialDBWrite)
Purpose: Write data from a serial connection to a DB.

### [SmoothScaling.py] (https://github.com/DaveKT/Utilities/tree/master/SmoothScaling)
Purpose: Demonstrate the use of a SIN function to transition gradually through some range. This version will draw a wave of "\*".
